# Escaped Identifiers

The backtick is used to escape keywords and reserved words for use as identifiers.  For example ```keyword``.

Backtick may also be a convenient way to mark other literals. For example:

  * Date times - ```2015-03-03``
  * Intervals - ```[3..6)``

Perhaps backtick could be used for operator overloading?  So `|| would be the method name for overloading operator '||'
