  * `then` could be used for Python style loop else.  This even allows for `while condition { } then { } else { }`. That is loop, do else if the loop never executes, do then block if the loop executes and ends without breaking.  Note though that a `then` without an `else` would execute even if the loop never did.  Another proposal would be `unless break`;
  * `repeat` - Swift style `repeat while` loops
  * `do` - `do while` or some kind of `do` block
  * `unless` - for the opposite of `if` or for `unless break` for Python style loop else.
  * `null` - for null pointers
  * `case`
  * `guard`
  * `switch`
  * `select`
  * `where`
  * `from`
  * `default`
  * `fallthrough`
  * `defer`
