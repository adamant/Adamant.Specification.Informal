# Enums

From http://tratt.net/laurie/blog/entries/another_non_argument_in_type_systems

"The basic idea is that sum types are a super type that ranges over other types. Whereas in OO languages a sub-class explicitly chooses its super-class(es), sum types (the super class equivalent) choose the types they range over (the subclass equivalent) â€” the latter have no idea which sum types they are ranged over by."

This might be a hint at how to define sum types.  Perhaps you can literally say a type is the sum of existing types



// Possible ways to declare enum values
public enum Example
{
	Name, // A unit typed value, inherits Example
	Constructor(3.14), // A unit typed value calling the constructor of Example with 3.14 
	Assignment = new() // A singleton like value, 
	{
	},
	AssignmentPlus = new :Something:Foo() // A singleton that doesn't actually have the type Example
	{
	},
	Typed: Type, // Like a field that has that type, i.e. discriminated union
	Tuple: (int, int), // Same as before, except the type is a tuple, can also use structs?
	Struct: // An anonymous type that inherits Example
	{
		
	},
	Class: class // basically an alternate to the syntax just above
	{
	},
